    <h1>How our app works</h1>

    <p style="width: 500px;">
            The user simply needs to input in the search bar the name of the item they desire and select the corresponding option from the scroll down menu.
            The program will search the database and display the carbon dioxide equivalent, a specific measure used to describe how much greenhouse gas is produced
            (and subsequently, its impact on global warming). The result is then converted to an index and assigned to one of four categories: very low impact,
            low impact, moderate impact or high impact. 
            For the more savvy or curious users, the program also displays a pie chart showing the source of the emissions – costs of cultivation and harvesting
            as well as the costs associated with storing, packing and transporting the produce. We hope to help consumers better understand the whole
            “farm-to-plate” process and visualize how different food items impact the environment.
