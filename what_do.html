    <h1>What we do</h1>

    <p style="width: 500px;">
            Our service helps users identify different food items' carbon footprint, that is,
            the quantity of greenhouse gas emissions produced by growing, farming, processing, storing,
            packaging and transporting food, from the farm to our plate. While there exists many databases
            that compile the carbon footprint of different products, most of these are inaccessible to the average consumer.
            Furthermore, even when available, these numbers may not help the individual decide what to purchase.
            While most people are aware of the general guidelines for greener living (e.g. purchasing local food), the issue is often much more complex.
