    <h1>What's next for Pompeii Solutions?</h1>

    <p style="width: 500px;">
            In the future, we hope to increase the ease of use and interactivity of our web application. We wish to include a scanner function with
            which the user can scan the desired item’s bar-code (instead of manually typing the item’s name). To help the user when making a purchase,
            a future version of the app could display side by side comparison of two desired products. Finally, we could include additional metrics, 
            such as water consumption in order to provide a deeper analysis.
